### Superscript

This isnâ€™t common, but some Markdown processors allow you to use superscript to position one or more characters slightly above the normal line of type. To create a superscript, use one caret symbol (^) before and after the characters.

```
X^2^
```

The rendered output looks like this:

X^2^
